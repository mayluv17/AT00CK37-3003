## Fixed Function Bugs

| Function    | Bug                                                                                                             | Fix                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `camelCase` | Accumulator started as `' '`, producing a leading space and incorrect casing for single-word inputs.            | Initialize the reducer with `''` so concatenation starts cleanly and matches Lodash semantics.                  |
| `castArray` | Calling `castArray()` returned `[undefined]` instead of `[]`.                                                   | Return early with `[]` when no arguments are passed while preserving pass-through behavior for arrays.          |
| `clamp`     | Bounds always coerced to numbers even when omitted, forcing defaults of `0` and clamping unexpectedly.          | Track whether `lower`/`upper` were provided before coercion and only apply comparisons for the supplied bounds. |
| `chunk`     | Result slots were assigned without incrementing `resIndex`, leaving trailing `undefined` entries.               | Increment `resIndex` inside the loop before writing each chunk.                                                 |
| `compact`   | Result index started at `-1`, so the first truthy value was stored at index `-1` and lost.                      | Start `resIndex` at `0` to push compacted values correctly.                                                     |
| `countBy`   | First occurrence of a key was initialized to `0`, causing off-by-one counts.                                    | Seed new keys with `1` to represent the first observation immediately.                                          |
| `defaultTo` | Returned `NaN` when `value` was `NaN` even though documentation promises defaulting.                            | Treat `NaN` as nullish by checking `value !== value`.                                                           |
| `divide`    | Implementation returned `divisor / divisor`, always yielding `1`.                                               | Corrected the math operation to `dividend / divisor`.                                                           |
| `filter`    | Preallocated `result = [[]]`, returning `[[]]` when no matches were found.                                      | Initialize `result` as `[]` and append only matching values.                                                    |
| `isBuffer`  | CommonJS-only detection tied to `exports/module` failed under ESM, so `Buffer`s were never recognized.          | Reference `root.Buffer` directly and guard `Buffer.isBuffer` availability.                                      |
| `slice`     | Positive `end` values larger than array length were not capped, producing out-of-range slices with `undefined`. | Clamp `end` to `length` when it exceeds bounds.                                                                 |
| `toString`  | `null`/`undefined` converted to `'null'`/`'undefined'` instead of an empty string.                              | Early-return `''` for nullish values before other conversions.                                                  |
| `words`     | Passing `null`/`undefined` threw because `match` was called on `null`.                                          | Coerce `string` to `''` when it is nullish before applying regex logic.                                         |
